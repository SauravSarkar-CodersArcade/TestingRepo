        Pillars of OOPS
        4 Pillars
        1. Abstraction   :
        2. Encapsulation :
        3. Polymorphism  :  Many forms    Lady (Sister)(Daughter)(Wife)(Employee)
        * method overriding
        * method overloading
        4. Inheritance   :
        Parent/Superclass
        Child/SubClass
        SuperClass/Base Class



The final keyword in java is used to restrict the user.
The java final keyword can be used in many context.
Final can be:

* variable
* method
* class
The final keyword can be applied with the variables,
a final variable that have no value it is called blank final variable or uninitialized final variable.
It can be initialized in the constructor only.
The blank final variable can be static also which will be initialized in the static block only.

1) Java final variable
If you make any variable as final, you cannot change the value of final variable(It will be constant).

Example of final variable
There is a final variable speedlimit, we are going to change the value of this variable,
but It can't be changed because final variable once assigned a value can never be changed.
